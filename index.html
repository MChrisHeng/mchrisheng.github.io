		About Me
	</h2>
	<p>
		I enjoy whitewater rafting, remodeling/dyi projects (power tools!!), gardening, playing my acoustic guitar, and hiking. During undergrad at USC, out in L.A., I took yoga as a college class, and studied for my other classes at the beach- it helped me get a 3.8 GPA. Currently, I'm excited with my new venture into technical marketing and tech startups right here in Boston!!
